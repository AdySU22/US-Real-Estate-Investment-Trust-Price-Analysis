# US Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) Price Analysis

Overview
In this project, I take on the role of a Data Analyst for a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) aiming to expand into the residential real estate market. The objective is to predict house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, and more. The analysis will provide insights into housing prices by leveraging the dataset, which contains house sales data for King County, including Seattle, covering transactions from May 2014 to May 2015. The provided template notebook serves as a foundation, and my task is to complete the analysis by answering a series of questions related to the dataset.
